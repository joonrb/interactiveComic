# Normalcy Test
## Are you a "normal" NYUAD student?
Have you ever wondered what is considered "normal" in NYUAD? Is it normal to eat alone in D2? Is it normal to decline party invites and choose to stay in your room? How should a "normal" student behave on this campus? "Normalcy Test" twists this belief that we must fit into the common norms. The project initially invites users to test their normalcy by answering how they would behave in the given situations. In the end, however, the website delivers a message that every individual is unique and there is no need to struggle to fit into the socially constructed normalcy. 

## Process
### Phase 1: Idea Development
The design inspiration I had was a collage of different images that delivers eccentric and comical mood. Before the first group meeting, I created the following moodboards to illustrate the visual I had in mind to other group members. Group members also liked the image collage idea so it was chosen as the main visual concept of our comic.

After our first meeting, we decided to create a comic that could guide students' life in NYUAD in terms of time management and balancing. We all resonated with the idea that when we first came to college we all felt so confused in deciding what is normal and what is not. We wanted to make a comic that could tell people that it is completely okay to deviate from what is perceived as "normal." 


### Phase 2: Prototype Design
After settling with the idea, we made a prototype design with Powerpoint to visualize the basic design. The below picture is the wireframe of our web comic I created. We were inspired by video games such as Mario that have a character fixed on one side and the changing background make it look like the character is walking forward. Fixing a GIF of walking person on the bottom-left corner and moving the background panel leftward could illustrate an NYUAD student navigating through different situations.

### Phase 3: Designing SVG Files
After confirming the wireframe design with other group members, I designed the panels for the opening, instructions, and the first two situations. We constantly communicated with each other to make sure the SVG files are in the same ratio, resolution, and sytem. 

The rest of the design other than image collages were kept as simple as possible to highlight the collages. To highlight the colors of the colages, we used as less colors as possible in other items such as speech bubble, ground, and the stick person. I incorporated the concept of image collage in the opening panel by using alphabet cutouts in title design. 

Another specific design choice I made is the pixelated speech bubbles. As our comic is an adventure of a NYUAD student through different situations, we wanted the comic to resemble the quest-clearing type of games in which a player encounter different characters and quests throughout the journey. The pixelated speech bubbles achieved this goal by highlighting the retro, game-like feature.

### Phase 4: Design Realization 
Jun realized the SVG designs by using html, javascript and css stylesheets. We constantly communicated with Jun to fix bugs and alter SVG files as needed. After the website was completed, I reoranized the image files on the github and rewrote the paths in the HTML file. Saiki and Isha also worked on the final touches on the website such as adjusting the padding and margins. 

## Reflection and Evaluation 
Our final comic turned out the way we initially visualized. I am truly amazed at how closely we realized our initial concept. I was worried about coding with different people as I have never experienced group coding prior to this project. However, it was an amazing experience working with my group members who were all very enthusiastic and committed. I look forward to other group projects in this class!
